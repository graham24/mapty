This is a simple JavaScript app that is used to track workouts on a map.

It uses local storage to save everything, and Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/) to load in the map.

See a live preview here: https://eager-booth-44d6a3.netlify.app/, continuously deplyed from GitHub to Netlify.

Instructions:

<ol>
<li>Click on the map in the location of your workout.</li>
<li>Enter the details of your workout.</li>
<li>Hit Enter to save your workout.</li>
<li>Click on an exisitng workout to center it on the map.</li>
</ol>

Keep in mind that the information is saved to localStorage, so this wornt transfer to other browsers, nad if you clear your website data, you will lose your past workouts!

Have fun!
